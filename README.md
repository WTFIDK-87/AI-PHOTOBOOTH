## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful workflow:

1.  **Mode Selection:** The user clicks one of the three spooky transformation buttons.
2.  **Capture Sequence:** The app starts a 3-second countdown and captures a single frame from the user's camera feed.
3.  **API Request:** The captured frame is sent to the Gemini API along with a carefully constructed prompt based on the selected mode.
4.  **AI Processing:** Gemini processes the input and generates a new, transformed image.
5.  **Display & Save:** The transformed image is displayed in the "CURSED" view and simultaneously added to the photo gallery at the bottom of the screen.

## üåê Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for a simple, no-build-step deployment, which is perfect for GitHub Pages.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1.  **Create a GitHub Repository:**
    - Make sure all the project files (`index.html`, `index.tsx`, `App.tsx`, etc.) are pushed to a GitHub repository.

2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
    - Click on the **Settings** tab.
    - In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
    - Under the "Build and deployment" section, for the **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
    - Choose the branch your code is on (e.g., `main` or `master`) and select the `/ (root)` folder.
    - Click **Save**.

3.  **Access Your Site:**
    - GitHub will generate and display a URL for your live site. It may take a few minutes for the site to become live.

### A Note on the API Key

This project is designed to run in an environment where the Gemini `API_KEY` is securely provided as an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`), such as Google AI Studio.
